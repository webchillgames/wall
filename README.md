# Colored wall generator

It's a special moment for me because I came up with this idea in a dream.

Over the past few days, I've been having dreams about coding, although they were usually about something strange. However, last night, I had a dream where my task was to create a 'generator of house wallpaper.'

The next morning, I woke up remembering the entire code I had figured out in my dream. It was a real working idea, so I immediately decided to write it down.

And here's the resultâ€”I did it! Pretty cool, isn't it?
